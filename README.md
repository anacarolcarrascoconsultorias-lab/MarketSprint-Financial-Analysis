# MarketSprint Acquisition — Financial Analysis Simulation  
**Author:** Ana C. Carrasco  
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook, **VS Code**, Financial Analysis, Scenario Modeling

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates the financial analysis of a potential acquisition involving *MarketSprint*, a mid-sized digital marketing company. The objective is to evaluate the company’s historical performance and assess post-acquisition financial viability under different growth and cost scenarios.

The analysis follows a realistic, analyst-style workflow: data preparation, profitability and margin analysis, trend visualization, and scenario-based projections to support an acquisition recommendation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze MarketSprint’s historical revenue, costs, and profitability
- Evaluate margin trends to assess operational efficiency and scalability
- Model post-acquisition financial scenarios under optimistic and risk assumptions
- Translate quantitative results into a clear acquisition recommendation

---

## 🧾 Data Overview
The dataset represents quarterly financials from 2022 to 2024 and includes:
- Revenue
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- Sales & Marketing expenses
- General & Administrative expenses
- R&D expenses
- Interest and tax expenses

All figures are simulated but structured to reflect realistic business behavior.

---

## 🧮 Financial Metrics
Key financial indicators were calculated:
- **Gross Profit**
- **Operating Profit**
- **Net Income**
- **Gross, Operating, and Net Margins**
- **Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) Growth Rates**

These metrics were used to evaluate profitability, efficiency, and operating leverage over time.

---

## 📊 Visual Analysis
Two main trend analyses were conducted:
- **Revenue vs Net Income:** showing consistent growth with improving profitability
- **Margin Trends:** demonstrating stable gross margins and expanding operating and net margins

The visuals highlight that MarketSprint is scaling efficiently rather than growing at the expense of profitability.

---

## 🔮 Scenario Modeling
Post-acquisition performance was simulated using two scenarios based on the most recent quarter:

### Optimistic Scenario
- Revenue growth: +10% QoQ  
- Operating expense growth: +6% QoQ  

### Risk Scenario
- Revenue growth: +6% QoQ  
- Operating expense growth: +9% QoQ  

Operating profit projections show significant upside in the optimistic case, while the risk scenario highlights sensitivity to cost control during integration.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
MarketSprint exhibits strong historical performance, improving margins, and clear operating leverage. Scenario analysis indicates that the acquisition is financially attractive under reasonable growth assumptions, with meaningful upside potential if cost discipline is maintained.

The primary risk lies in post-acquisition operating expense control. With focused integration planning and expense governance, the acquisition is likely to create value rather than dilute profitability.
